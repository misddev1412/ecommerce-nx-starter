Below is a comprehensive guide tailored to your project context.\n\n1. Setting Up Firebase Project:\n   - Create a Firebase Project in the Firebase Console and enable Google and Facebook sign-in methods.\n   - Obtain configuration details (API key, Auth domain, Project ID, etc.) for your NestJS application.\n\n2. Installing Firebase SDK:\n   - Install the Firebase Admin SDK and Firebase client SDK using npm.\n\n3. Configuring Firebase Admin SDK:\n   - Create a service to handle Firebase authentication and initialize the Firebase Admin SDK with your project credentials.\n\n4. Implementing Google and Facebook OAuth:\n   - Integrate Google and Facebook sign-in in your frontend application using Firebase client SDK.\n   - Create backend endpoints to verify tokens received from the frontend.\n\n5. JWT Token Generation:\n   - Generate a JWT token for authenticated users using the jsonwebtoken library.\n\n6. Security Best Practices:\n   - Store sensitive information in environment variables, serve your application over HTTPS, implement token expiration and refresh logic, apply rate limiting, and ensure comprehensive error handling.\n\n7. Testing Strategy:\n   - Cover user registration, token generation, and security tests in your testing strategy.\n\n8. Edge Cases and Potential Pitfalls:\n   - Handle token expiry, ensure user data consistency, and prepare for various error scenarios.\n</info added on 2025-06-17T08:28:35.464Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-17T08:37:29.760Z>\nFirebase Authentication implementation completed:\n\nCOMPLETED COMPONENTS:\n1.

Auth Service: Implemented Google/Facebook OAuth login, JWT token generation, user creation/update\n4. Auth Controller: Created endpoints for Google/Facebook login, profile, logout, verify, health check\n5. JWT Strategy: Implemented Passport JWT strategy for protected routes\n6. JWT Guard: Created authentication guard for route protection\n7. App Module: Updated with all Firebase, Auth, JWT, Passport modules\n8. Environment Variables: Added Firebase and JWT configuration to .env file\n\nFEATURES IMPLEMENTED:\n- Google OAuth via Firebase\n- Facebook OAuth via Firebase  \n- JWT token generation (15min access + 7day refresh)\n- User creation/update from OAuth providers\n- Protected routes with JWT authentication\n- Token verification and user validation\n- Logout with Firebase token revocation\n- Comprehensive error handling and logging\n\nSECURITY BEST PRACTICES:\n- Short-lived access tokens (15min)\n- Long-lived refresh tokens (7 days)\n- Firebase token verification\n- User status validation (active check)\n- Environment variable configuration\n- Proper error handling without exposing sensitive data\n\nNEXT STEPS NEEDED:\n1.

        "details": "Currently backend/src/app contains all services, controllers, entities, guards, and strategies mixed together which makes the codebase hard to maintain and scale. Need to reorganize into proper NestJS modular structure:\n\n- Create modules folder with separate modules (auth, user, database, etc.)\n- Move controllers to their respective module folders\n- Move services to their respective module folders\n- Organize entities properly (shared/entities or per-module)\n- Move guards and strategies to auth module\n- Create proper barrel exports (index.ts files)\n- Update all imports across the codebase\n- Follow domain-driven design principles\n- Ensure clean separation of concerns\n\nThis refactoring will make the codebase much more maintainable and scalable for future development.\n<info added on 2025-06-17T08:58:59.542Z>\nResearch on NestJS folder structure best practices for 2024 emphasizes the importance of a modular architecture, particularly for e-commerce applications. The recommended structure includes a dedicated modules folder for encapsulating features like authentication, user management, product catalog, and order processing. Each module should contain its own controller, service, and related entities, while a shared module can hold common utilities and DTOs. Barrel exports should be utilized to simplify imports, and a clear configuration and migrations folder structure is advised. This approach enhances maintainability, scalability, and testability, allowing for easier management of dependencies and promoting code reusability. Additionally, considerations for scalability, testing, and potential pitfalls such as circular dependencies and naming conventions are crucial for a successful implementation.\n</info added on 2025-06-17T08:58:59.542Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-17T09:30:19.270Z>\n✅ BACKEND FOLDER STRUCTURE REFACTORING COMPLETED\n\n**Migration Files Reorganization:**\n- Successfully moved old migration `1750148657559-CreateUserTable.ts` from `backend/src/migrations/` to `backend/migrations/`\n- Deleted old migration file and removed empty `backend/src/migrations/` directory\n- Updated typeorm config to point to correct paths:\n  - entities: `src/shared/entities/*.entity{.ts,.js}`\n  - migrations: `migrations/*{.ts,.js}`\n\n**Final Build Test:**\n- Backend builds successfully with `npx nx build backend`\n- No compilation errors\n- All imports and module structure working correctly\n\n**Complete Refactoring Summary:**\n✅ **Modular Structure Created:**\n   - `modules/auth/` - Authentication module with controller, service, guards, strategies\n   - `modules/user/` - User management module\n   - `modules/database/` - Database service module\n   - `shared/entities/` - Shared entity definitions\n   - `config/` - Configuration files\n\n✅ **File Reorganization:**\n   - Moved auth components from `app/` to `modules/auth/`\n   - Moved user.entity.ts to `shared/entities/`\n   - Moved database.service.ts to `modules/database/`\n   - Moved typeorm.config.ts to `config/`\n\n✅ **Code Updates:**\n   - Updated AuthService to use UserService instead of direct repository\n   - Updated JWT Strategy to use UserService for validation\n   - Updated main app.module.ts to use new modular imports\n   - Fixed all import paths throughout codebase\n\n✅ **Database Migration:**\n   - Successfully ran migration to add firebaseUid and provider fields\n   - Migration files properly organized in correct directory\n\n✅ **Build Verification:**\n   - Backend compiles successfully with no errors\n   - All modules properly imported and exported\n\nThe backend now follows NestJS best practices with a clean, modular architecture that is maintainable and scalable!\n</info added on 2025-06-17T09:30:19.270Z>",
